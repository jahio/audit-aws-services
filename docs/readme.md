# Help Docs for `aws-audit`

The purpose of this directory is to hold plain-text markdown files that can be shown to the user if they were to type something like `aws-audit help SOMETHING`. This document (`readme.md`) is NOT intended to be part of that help documentation set; it's merely provided here to explain the presence of this directory and everything under it. (It's metadata, that's it.)
